            I know things may not be perfect right now, and I understand that you might be upset and jealous about that case. I just want you to know that you mean the world to me, and I cherish every moment we spend together. You bring so much happiness into my life, and I’m grateful for you every single day. Even during the tough times, I am here for you, and I will never leave you. Please know that I love you deeply and endlessly, and I’ll always be here to support you. It took me two nights to make this, I hope my little project could make you happy. Mwahhhhhhh ❤️

        <p class="closing">Forever yours,</p>
